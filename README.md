# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

**Project Overview**

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial analysis tasks. It leverages deep learning techniques to classify or recognize facial attributes such as expressions, age, or gender. The project uses standard libraries and is designed to be modular and reproducible.

**Features**

1. CNN architecture for feature extraction from facial images.
2. Image preprocessing: resizing, normalization.
3. Model training and evaluation.
4. Performance metrics like accuracy and loss visualization.
